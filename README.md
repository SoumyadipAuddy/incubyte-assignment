# incubyte-assignment

I have detailed out how to run the code, assumptions and outputs in the attached pdf file `How to run, assumptions and outputs.pdf`.
Also i have attached raw csv file wish is a made up dataset for my python program.
The main code is in my `run.py`.

Here python and mongodb have been used. Steps to query the mongodb database can be found in the pdf file.

Deliverables:
1. Create Table queries - Not necessary as my python code will generate the tables automatically even if the tables dont exist.
2. script or program which reads the data from flies - run.py attached. This reads raw_data.csv
